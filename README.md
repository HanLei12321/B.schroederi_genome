01.assembly

Codes for de novo genome assembly and annotation.

02.phylogeny

Codes for species tree construction.

03.variant.calling

Codes for WGS data preprocessing. variant calling and filtering.

04.population

Codes for PCA, genetic diversity, and structure analysis.

05.demography

Codes for effective population size estimation, and divergence analysis.

06.Nextdenovo_polish_genome

Genome files (intermediate files) after Nexdenove and polish.  Since the github upload file size limit is 100Mb, We splited the genome file into 3 parts and then upload. The user uses the following command line to obtain the complete genome file.
cat Scaffolds_part1.fasta Scaffolds_part2.fasta Scaffolds_part2.fasta >B.schroederi_genome.fasta
